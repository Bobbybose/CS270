CS 270 Project 4: TINY Web Server and Calculator
Author: Bobby Bose
NOTE: csapp.h, csapp.c, and tiny.c were used for this project and were taken from http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/3e/code.html
      adder.c from same site was used as starting point for calc.c

Limitations: Program will default to multiplication if client user tries to do an operation that isn't add, subtract, or multiply.

Instructions on compiling: Type "make" or "make all" to compile both tiny and calc
                           Type "make tiny" or "make calc" to only compile tiny or calc respectively
                           Can type "make clean" to remove tiny and calc executables
                           Can type "make tar" to create a tarbell of everything in working_dir

Program runs with 1 argument: the port. Port 8000 was used during creation of project and testing should be done using that port aswell
      Example run command: "./tiny 8000"

URL for TINY Web Server homepage is http://login_id.cs.uky.edu:8000
URL for Calculator is: http://login_id.cs.uky.edu:8000/p4calculator.html
      Can also use http://login_id.cs.uky.edu:8000/cgi-bin/calc?op=add&operand1=2&operand2=2
            Can change add to subtract or multiply
            Can change numbers after operand= statements to change the operands for the operation

TINY Web Server homepage just displays an image and small text underneath
Calculator page can be used to calculate simple add/subtract/multiply operations
